My name is Jérémie Peres. I am currently about to graduate from a Post Master’s Degree in Data Science at Télécom Paris after working for more than 2 years in strategy and management consulting. I am looking for an opportunity in Data Science starting from September 2020.

After graduating from CentraleSupélec in 2017, I joined the French strategy and management consulting firm Vertone. While there, I had the opportunity to carry out a wide variety of missions, both strategic and operational, for companies in the transport, energy and insurance sectors.

I am currently doing a Post Master's Degree in Data Science at Telecom Paris, from which I will graduate in 2020. In parallel to the courses, I am also applying my freshly acquired data science skills to real-life projects, carrying out a student research project for Veepee where I am building a price elasticity model. I also participated in several hackathons, including one organized by l’X and Carrefour: a 10 weeks project building a local Marketing Mix Modeling which my team and I won.

If you would like to get to know more about me, feel free to check out my [resume](/assets/files/CV.pdf), my [projects](/projects) and my [articles](/articles)

[Contact me](mailto:jeremieperes@gmail.com) if you have any question or if you want us to work together.
